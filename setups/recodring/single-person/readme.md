# Recording a Single Person(s)

## Set Up

* Camera
* SlingStudio (and iOS or Android device) or laptop
* Storage media for recording and or transfer from SlingStudio or laptop.

Since this is a single person the camera mic will likely be enough. SlingStuidio or the laptop will record to the service of your choise.
An iOS or Android device will run the StreamStudio mobile application to manage the StreamStudio hub recording to an SD card.
Should a laptop be used the recording from the camera will be stored on the hard drive or any connected drive you provide.
